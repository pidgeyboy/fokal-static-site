            <h2>What information do we collect?</h2>
            <p>
                The kind of Personal Information that we collect from you will depend on how you use the website. The Personal Information which we collect and hold about you may include:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>login credentials;</li>

            <h2>Types of information</h2>
            <p>
                The Privacy Act 1998 (Cth) (Privacy Act) defines types of information, including Personal Information and Sensitive Information.
            </p>
            <p>
                Personal Information means information or an opinion about an identified individual or an individual who is reasonably identifiable:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>whether the information or opinion is true or not; and</li>
                <li>whether the information or opinion is recorded in a material form or not.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                If the information does not disclose your identity or enable your identity to be ascertained, it will in most cases not be classified as "Personal Information" and will not be subject to this privacy policy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Sensitive Information is defined in the Privacy Act as including information or opinion about such things as an individual's racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, membership of a political association, religious or philosophical beliefs, membership of a trade union or other professional body, criminal record or health information.
            </p>
            <p>Sensitive Information will be used by us only:</p>
            <ol type="a">
                <li>for the primary purpose for which it was obtained;</li>
                <li>for a secondary purpose that is directly related to the primary purpose; and</li>
                <li>with your consent or where required or authorised by law.</li>

            <h2>Overseas transfer</h2>
            <p>
                Your Personal Information may be transferred overseas or stored overseas for a variety of reasons. It is not possible to identify each and every country to which your Personal Information may be sent. If your Personal Information is sent to a recipient in a country with data protection laws which are at least substantially similar to the Australian Privacy Principles, and where there are mechanisms available to you to enforce protection of your Personal Information under that overseas law, we will not be liable for a breach of the Australian Privacy Principles if your Personal Information is mishandled in that jurisdiction. If your Personal Information is transferred to a jurisdiction which does not have data protection laws as comprehensive as Australia's, we will take reasonable steps to secure a contractual commitment from the recipient to handle your information in accordance with the Australian Privacy Principles.

            <h2>GDPR</h2>
            <p>
                In some circumstances, the European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) provides additional protection to individuals located in Europe. The fact that you may be located in Europe does not, however, on its own entitle you to protection under the GDPR. Our website does not specifically target customers located in the European Union and we do not monitor the behaviour of individuals in the European Union, and accordingly the GDPR does not apply.
