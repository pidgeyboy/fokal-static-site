## What Google & Bing Agree On (Summary Section)

Both Google and Microsoft have published extensive guidance on AI search. Here are the 8 points where they're in complete agreement:

### 1. No Special AI Optimization Required
Google's Danny Sullivan: "There's not a lot you actually really need to be worrying about" regarding new AI optimization tactics. Focus on quality content for humans, not AI-specific tricks.

### 2. E-E-A-T Signals Matter More
Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trustworthiness. Both platforms are amplifying these signals in AI search results. Authority comes from genuine expertise, not keyword optimization.

### 3. Structured Data Helps But Isn't Magic
Danny Sullivan: "Structured data could be helpful for AI formats but is not a secret weapon." It helps systems understand your content, but won't compensate for thin content.

### 4. Multimodal Content Creates Opportunities
Sullivan: "If you have been more textual in nature and you haven't been doing images or video, then by making sure you have more content-rich original content, you potentially are going to have opportunities."

### 5. Conversion Quality > Traffic Quantity
Bing Webmaster Blog: "The path to conversion no longer starts with a click." Users arriving from AI formats are more engaged and have higher intent clarity. Measure quality, not just volume.

### 6. Technical Fundamentals Still Matter
Crawlability, sitemaps, canonical tags, lastmod timestamps. Bing: "The lastmod field in your sitemap remains a key signal, helping Bing prioritize URLs for recrawling and reindexing."

### 7. Duplicate Content Hurts AI Visibility
Bing: "LLMs cluster near-duplicate URLs and select one to represent the set—potentially an outdated version." Consolidate signals. Less is more.

### 8. Citations Are the New Visibility Metric
Bing: "Citations and placement in AI answers are becoming the visibility signals that decide who enters the final click." Being referenced matters as much as ranking.

## What is AI Search?

AI search represents a fundamental shift in how people find information online. Instead of returning a list of blue links, AI-powered search engines like Google's AI Overviews, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot synthesize information from multiple sources into direct answers.

This changes the game for content creators. Traditional SEO focused on ranking #1 for specific keywords. AI search focuses on being cited as a trusted source when the AI constructs its response. Your content might never appear as a clickable link, but it could be the primary source the AI uses to answer millions of queries.

The technology behind this is complex—involving large language models, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and sophisticated ranking algorithms—but the implications are straightforward: quality, authority, and clarity matter more than ever.

### The Major Players

**Google AI Overviews** (formerly SGE): Appears at the top of Google search results for many queries, synthesizing information from multiple sources with inline citations.

**ChatGPT with Search**: OpenAI's integration of real-time web search into ChatGPT, citing sources inline as it generates responses.

**Perplexity**: A dedicated AI search engine that emphasizes source attribution and factual accuracy.

**Microsoft Copilot**: Bing's AI assistant, powered by GPT-4, integrated across Microsoft products.

**Google Gemini**: Google's multimodal AI, increasingly integrated into search experiences.

---

## How Do You Optimize for AI Search?

The short answer: by creating genuinely helpful content that demonstrates expertise. Both Google and Bing have been clear that there's no secret trick or special optimization tactic for AI search.

### Focus on Original Voice
Danny Sullivan: "Your original voice is that thing that only you can provide. It's your particular take." Commodity content—basic factual information—is increasingly handled by AI directly. What AI can't replicate is your unique perspective, experience, and expertise.

### Prioritize Task Completion
Google's internal quality metrics focus on whether users complete their task. Sullivan: "Did the user solve their problem?" That's the quality signal. Structure your content to help users accomplish what they came to do.

### Technical Foundations Matter
While there's no AI-specific technical optimization, the fundamentals are more important than ever:
- Accurate sitemaps with proper lastmod timestamps
- Clean URL structures with canonical tags
- Fast, crawlable pages
- Structured data for key content types

### Avoid Duplicate Content
Bing's research shows that duplicate content actively hurts AI visibility by diluting authority signals and confusing intent interpretation. Consolidate similar pages and use canonical tags properly.

After analyzing official guidance from Google Search Liaison Danny Sullivan, Google Search Advocate John Mueller, and Microsoft's Bing team, we identified 8 points of complete consensus on AI search optimization. The core message: there's no special trick. Quality content, technical fundamentals, and genuine expertise matter more than ever.

---

## The 8 Consensus Points

### 1. No Special AI Optimization Required

**Google (Danny Sullivan, Search Off the Record podcast):**
> "There's not a lot you actually really need to be worrying about" regarding new AI optimization tactics.

> "The more you're trying to optimize or GEO or whatever you think it is for a specific kind of system, the more you're potentially going to get away from the main goal."

**What this means:** Stop chasing "AEO" or "GEO" tactics. Focus on creating genuinely helpful content.

---

### 2. E-E-A-T Signals Matter More

**Google (Search Central Blog, May 2025):**
> "E-E-A-T (Experience, Expertise, Authoritativeness, Trustworthiness) remains crucial for AI-driven search."

> "Produce authoritative, well-researched material demonstrating genuine expertise."

**What this means:** Authority signals are amplified in AI search. Demonstrate genuine expertise through content quality, not keyword tricks.

---

### 3. Structured Data Helps But Isn't Magic

**Google (Danny Sullivan):**
> "Structured data could be helpful for AI formats but is not a secret weapon—it wasn't your secret. Aha, structured data now I have it."

**Google (Search Central Blog):**
> "Implement proper schema markup/structured data to help AI systems understand content."

**What this means:** Structured data helps systems understand your content, but it won't compensate for thin or low-quality content.

---

### 4. Multimodal Content Creates Opportunities

**Google (Danny Sullivan):**
> "If you have been more textual in nature and you haven't been doing images or video, then by making sure you have more content-rich original content, you potentially are going to have opportunities."

> "Multimodal means searching one way and getting information back another (e.g., video query → text response)."

**What this means:** Diversify beyond text. Images, video, and audio content will have more opportunities in AI search.

---

### 5. Conversion Quality > Traffic Quantity

**Bing Webmaster Blog (November 2025):**
> "The path to conversion no longer starts with a click."

> "Citations and placement in AI answers are becoming the visibility signals that decide who enters the final click."

**Google (Danny Sullivan):**
> "AI formats put people into a better state of contextual awareness—users understand better what they're getting into."

> "People arriving from AI formats seem to be more engaged when they get there."

**What this means:** Measure quality of conversions, not just traffic volume. AI visitors have higher intent clarity.

---

### 6. Technical Fundamentals Still Matter

**Bing Webmaster Blog (July 2025):**
> "The lastmod field in your sitemap remains a key signal, helping Bing prioritize URLs for recrawling and reindexing."

**Google (John Mueller):**
> "If you're using a popular CMS like WordPress or Wix, you don't have to worry about any of those technical details."

**What this means:** Sitemaps, canonical tags, crawlability—the fundamentals persist. Get them right once, then focus on content.

---

### 7. Duplicate Content Hurts AI Visibility

**Bing Webmaster Blog (December 2025):**
> "Duplicate content doesn't trigger search penalties on its own, but reduces visibility by diluting authority, confusing intent, and slowing updates."

> "LLMs cluster near-duplicate URLs and select one to represent the set—potentially an outdated version."

> "Less is more. Clean, consolidated signals help search engines understand intent."

**What this means:** Consolidate similar content. Use canonical tags. Don't create pages for every keyword variation.

---

### 8. Citations Are the New Visibility Metric

**Bing Webmaster Blog (November 2025):**
> "Citations and placement in AI answers are becoming the visibility signals that decide who enters the final click."

**Bing (Copilot Search announcement, April 2025):**
> "Prominently cites sources so users know exactly where the information came from."

> "Inline links embed citations throughout responses."

**What this means:** Being cited in AI answers matters as much as ranking in traditional search. Track citations, not just rankings.

> "Join a transformative project to overhaul the Google Search stack, ensuring Large Language Models (LLMs) and machine learning are core components."

> "We're reimagining what it means to search for information – any way and anywhere."

### Key Strategic Choices

**1. Evolution, Not Revolution**
Google is modernizing existing infrastructure, not starting over. This preserves their ranking signals, index, and user data while adding AI capabilities.

**2. AI as Core Component**
LLMs are becoming central to the search stack, not just a feature layer on top. This is a fundamental architectural change.

**3. Scale Advantage**
Google's existing systems serve billions of users. Any AI addition must work at that scale immediately.

**4. Cross-Team Investment**
AI search touches "every part of the org" according to job postings. This is company-wide transformation.

**5. PhD-Level Research**
Google is hiring PhDs for 2026 start dates, signaling long-term fundamental research investment.

### Google's Bet
The bet is that massive scale, existing data advantages, and incremental improvement will beat ground-up rebuilds—and that their advertising model can adapt to AI search.

## What This Means for Content Creators

### The Convergence
Both companies agree on the destination: AI-powered search that synthesizes information and cites sources. The question is which approach gets there with better quality, speed, and reliability.

### Practical Implications

**1. Both Will Cite Sources**
Bing's Copilot and Google's AI Overviews both emphasize citations. Being cited matters in both futures.

**2. Quality Signals Intensify**
Google's "autoraters" and focus on quality evaluation means automated judgment of content quality. OpenAI's "optimized for LLM to use" means structured, clear content wins.

**3. Speed Matters**
Both emphasize performance. Slow-to-crawl sites lose visibility.

**4. Multimodal is Coming**
Google's visual search patents and both companies' emphasis on multimodal means text-only content is increasingly disadvantaged.

### Strategic Positioning

**For Google-first brands:**
- Technical SEO fundamentals remain critical
- Structured data helps AI understand content
- Existing authority signals carry over

**For AI-first brands:**
- Clear, factual, well-structured content
- Real-time or frequently updated information
- API accessibility for agent integration

---

## The Bottom Line

Google has scale and search history. OpenAI has product focus and AI-native architecture. Both are investing billions. For content creators, the safe bet is to optimize for both: quality content that's technically accessible, clearly structured, and genuinely authoritative.

# RESEARCH BRIEF: How LLMs Select Citations (/llm-citation-selection)

## Hero

**Badge:** FOKAL RESEARCH

**H1:** How LLMs Select Citations

**Subtitle:** The mechanics of AI citation selection—duplicate content, crawl signals, and URL clustering

**Meta:** Sources: Bing Webmaster Blog, Google Search Central, USPTO patents

---

## Executive Summary

When an AI generates a response, it must decide which sources to cite. This process is fundamentally different from traditional ranking. LLMs cluster similar content, select representative sources, and make decisions about freshness and authority. Understanding this process is essential for AI search visibility.

---

## Key Finding: Duplicate Content Actively Hurts AI Visibility

Bing Webmaster Blog (December 2025) provided unprecedented clarity:

> "LLMs cluster near-duplicate URLs and select one to represent the set—potentially an outdated version."

> "Intent signals become harder to interpret when multiple pages repeat information."

> "Similar pages reduce signals for matching each page to unique user needs."

> "Updates take longer reaching AI-generated results when crawlers prioritize duplicate URLs."

### The Mechanism
1. AI systems identify similar content across URLs
2. They cluster these URLs together
3. They select ONE to represent the entire cluster
4. The selection may favor an outdated version
5. Your latest updates may be ignored

### The Solution
> "Less is more. Clean, consolidated signals help search engines understand intent."

---

## How Crawl Signals Affect Citation Selection

### Lastmod Timestamps
Bing (July 2025):
> "The lastmod field in your sitemap remains a key signal, helping Bing prioritize URLs for recrawling and reindexing."

**Best practices:**
- Use ISO 8601 formatting (date and time)
- Set lastmod to actual content modification date
- Don't set lastmod to sitemap generation time

### Sitemap Structure
> "XML is the preferred sitemap format because it supports structured metadata like lastmod."

**Specifications:**
- Individual sitemaps: up to 50,000 URLs
- Sitemap index: up to 50,000 child sitemaps
- Theoretical maximum: 2.5 billion URLs per index

### IndexNow
> "Sitemaps + IndexNow together provide the structure and speed search engines need to keep your content visible."

IndexNow notifies search engines immediately when content changes.

---

## Authority Signal Dilution

When duplicate content exists:

**What happens to authority signals:**
- Clicks split across multiple URLs
- Links distributed across duplicates
- Impressions fragmented
- Engagement signals diluted

**What happens to AI understanding:**
- Intent signals become ambiguous
- Freshness becomes unclear
- Authority becomes distributed

**Result:** The AI may cite a competitor with consolidated signals over your diluted content.

---

## Practical Recommendations

### Consolidation Strategy

| Situation | Solution |
|-----------|----------|
| Syndicated content | Canonical tag pointing to original |
| Multiple campaign pages | One primary page + canonicals on variations |
| Similar pages for different keywords | Merge into single comprehensive page |
| Localized versions | Meaningful localization + hreflang tags |

### Technical Implementation

**1. Canonical Tags**
Point all variations to the authoritative version.

**2. Content Consolidation**
Only maintain separate pages when intent clearly differs.

**3. Localization**
> "Localize with meaningful changes (terminology, regulations, product details)."

Don't just translate—adapt for local context.

**4. Update Notification**
Use IndexNow to notify search engines of changes immediately.

---

## The Query Fan-Out Model

Google's John Mueller explained how AI search works differently:

> "Query fan out: AI search performs multiple incremental searches for you and synthesizes results."

### Implications
1. AI doesn't just match your page to a query
2. It runs multiple related searches
3. It synthesizes information from multiple sources
4. Your content competes at the synthesis level, not the keyword level

### What This Means
- Comprehensive content beats narrow keyword targeting
- Unique perspectives get synthesized; commodity information is sourced generically
- Being the best answer for a query matters more than matching keywords

---

## Patent Insights: Query Routing

Google Patent US-20250370993-A1:

> "The system uses a trained model to assess two critical factors—sampling ratios from event-level data and information loss from pre-aggregated datasets—to determine which source will produce superior accuracy within acceptable latency constraints."

### Translation
Google dynamically chooses which data sources to use for each query based on:
- Accuracy requirements
- Latency constraints
- Source quality signals

Your content competes against aggregated datasets and other sources for inclusion in AI responses.

---

## The Citation Selection Process

Based on our analysis, here's how LLMs likely select citations:

1. **Query understanding**: Parse user intent
2. **Retrieval**: Fetch candidate sources via RAG
3. **Clustering**: Group similar/duplicate content
4. **Selection**: Choose representative sources per cluster
5. **Authority scoring**: Weight by E-E-A-T signals
6. **Freshness weighting**: Consider lastmod and update frequency
7. **Synthesis**: Generate response using selected sources
8. **Citation insertion**: Attribute claims to sources

### Where You Can Win
- Be the authoritative source in your cluster
- Have the freshest, most accurate content
- Consolidate signals on canonical URLs
- Update frequently and notify via IndexNow

# RESEARCH BRIEF: AI Search Conversions (/ai-search-conversions)

## Hero

**Badge:** FOKAL RESEARCH

**H1:** AI Search Conversion Metrics

**Subtitle:** The path to conversion no longer starts with a click

**Meta:** Sources: Bing Webmaster Blog, Google Search Liaison Danny Sullivan

---

## Executive Summary

Traditional search metrics—impressions, clicks, rankings—are becoming less relevant in AI search. Users get information directly from AI responses, often without clicking through. This brief examines how to measure success when "the path to conversion no longer starts with a click."

---

## The Paradigm Shift

Bing Webmaster Blog (November 2025):

> "The path to conversion no longer starts with a click."

> "Citations and placement in AI answers are becoming the visibility signals that decide who enters the final click."

> "Publishers, SEOs, and content owners need to understand shifting user behavior inside AI experiences."

### What Changed
| Old Model | New Model |
|-----------|-----------|
| User searches → Clicks result → Converts | User searches → Reads AI answer → Maybe clicks → Converts |
| Impressions measure visibility | Citations measure visibility |
| CTR is primary metric | Citation rate is primary metric |
| Traffic volume matters | Traffic quality matters more |

---

## The Quality Trade-Off

Danny Sullivan (Google Search Off the Record):

> "AI formats put people into a better state of contextual awareness—users understand better what they're getting into."

> "People arriving from AI formats seem to be more engaged when they get there."

> "AI formats speed up that process of users refining queries to find what they actually need."

### The Engagement Evidence
- Users from AI search have higher intent clarity
- They spend more time on site after clicking
- They're more likely to complete tasks
- They're pre-qualified by AI's synthesis

### The Volume Trade-Off
- Fewer total clicks from AI search
- But higher conversion rate per click
- Quality over quantity

---

## New Metrics Framework

### Visibility Metrics (Pre-Click)

| Metric | Description | How to Track |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| Citation Rate | % of queries where you're cited | AI visibility monitoring tools |
| Citation Position | Where in the response you appear | Manual review or monitoring |
| Citation Context | How you're described when cited | Semantic analysis of citations |
| Competitor Citation | Who else is cited alongside you | Competitive monitoring |

### Engagement Metrics (Post-Click)

| Metric | Description | Why It Matters |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| Time on Site | Duration of visit | AI visitors should engage longer |
| Pages per Session | Depth of engagement | Quality traffic goes deeper |
| Bounce Rate | Single-page exits | AI traffic should bounce less |
| Task Completion | Goal achievement rate | The ultimate success metric |

### Conversion Metrics

| Metric | Description | AI-Era Consideration |
|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| Conversion Rate | Actions / Visits | Should improve with AI traffic |
| Revenue per Visit | Revenue / Visits | Quality traffic = higher RPV |
| Assisted Conversions | AI as part of path | Track AI in multi-touch attribution |
| Customer Quality | LTV of acquired customers | AI traffic may have higher LTV |

---

## Danny Sullivan's Guidance

> "Recommendation: Measure quality clicks and quality conversions, not just raw traffic."

### Quality Indicators
1. **Task completion**: Did the user accomplish their goal?
2. **Engagement depth**: Did they explore your content?
3. **Return visits**: Did they come back?
4. **Conversion value**: What's the revenue impact?

---

## Practical Implementation

### Step 1: Track AI Traffic Sources

Identify visits from AI search:
- Referrer analysis (chatgpt.com, perplexity.ai, etc.)
- Google AI Overview click patterns
- UTM parameters for AI campaigns

### Step 2: Segment Analytics

Compare AI traffic vs. traditional:
- Engagement metrics by source
- Conversion rates by source
- Revenue by source

### Step 3: Monitor Citations

Use AI visibility tools to track:
- Which queries cite your brand
- Citation position and context
- Competitive citation landscape

### Step 4: Adjust Attribution

Update attribution models:
- Include AI as a touchpoint
- Weight by engagement quality
- Consider assisted conversions

---

## The Citation Economy

Bing (Copilot Search announcement, April 2025):

> "Prominently cites sources so users know exactly where the information came from."

> "Inline links embed citations throughout responses."

> "One-click access to all source links used in generation."

### What This Means
- Being cited IS visibility
- Citation placement affects click-through
- Context of citation affects perception
- Earning citations = earning attention

---

## Case Study: Rethinking Success

### Old Metrics
- "We ranked #1 for 500 keywords"
- "We got 100,000 clicks from search"
- "Our CTR improved 15%"

### New Metrics
- "We're cited in AI responses for 500 queries"
- "AI traffic converts at 3x our average rate"
- "AI-sourced customers have 40% higher LTV"

---

## Recommendations

### For Measurement
1. Add AI traffic segmentation to analytics
2. Implement AI citation monitoring
3. Track task completion, not just pageviews
4. Update attribution for AI touchpoints

### For Optimization
1. Optimize for citation-worthiness (factual, clear, authoritative)
2. Improve post-click experience for high-intent visitors
3. Design conversion paths for informed, ready-to-act users
4. Build for engagement depth, not just traffic volume

### For Reporting
1. Report citation metrics alongside rankings
2. Emphasize quality metrics (conversion rate, engagement)
3. Track revenue contribution, not just traffic
4. Compare AI traffic performance vs. traditional
