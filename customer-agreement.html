        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 11, 2025</p>

        <div class="separator"></div>

        <section>
            <h2>Preamble</h2>
            <p>
                This Customer Agreement ("<strong>Agreement</strong>") is a legally-binding contract between <strong>Altair Innovations Pty Ltd</strong>, an Australian company incorporated in New South Wales with its registered office in Sydney ("<strong>Fokal</strong>", "<strong>we</strong>", "<strong>our</strong>", "<strong>us</strong>"), and the individual or entity accepting these terms ("<strong>Customer</strong>", "<strong>you</strong>", "<strong>your</strong>"). By creating an account, clicking "I Agree", or otherwise accessing or using the Fokal platform, you acknowledge that you have read, understood, and agree to be bound by this Agreement.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of a company or other organisation, you represent that you have authority to bind that entity; in that case, "you" and "your" refer to that entity.
            </p>
        </section>

        <div class="separator"></div>

        <section>
            <h2>1. Definitions</h2>
            <p><strong>1.1 "Service"</strong> means the web-based Fokal software-as-a-service platform, including its dashboards, analytics, and any related websites, documentation, features, or content that we make available to you now or in the future.</p>
            <p><strong>1.2 "Starter Plan"</strong> means the single-seat, single-brand subscription tier currently priced at US $50 per month or US $500 per year (paid up front).</p>
            <p><strong>1.3 "Customer Data"</strong> means any data, content, domain names, websites, or other materials that you submit to, or authorise us to retrieve or process through, the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>1.4 "Generated Output"</strong> means any text, images, metrics, reports, or other content produced by the Service—including any content created by generative AI models—based on Customer Data, public data, or other inputs.</p>
            <p><strong>1.5 "Proprietary Metrics"</strong> means Fokal-generated metrics such as "AI Visibility Rate", "Recommendation Score", "Share-of-Voice %", or any successor metrics or scores branded by Fokal.</p>
            <p><strong>1.6 "Sub-Processor"</strong> means any third-party service provider we engage to process data on our behalf (e.g. Render, AWS, OpenAI, Stripe, Mixpanel, Google OAuth).</p>
        </section>

        <div class="separator"></div>

        <section>
            <h2>2. Scope of Service</h2>
            <p><strong>2.1 Starter-Only Access.</strong> During the Subscription Term (Section 8.1) and subject to compliance with this Agreement, we grant you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable right to access and use the Service under the Starter Plan for one (1) natural person user and one (1) brand domain only. No public API, bulk-data export, or multi-user functionality is included.</p>
            <p><strong>2.2 Internal Business Use.</strong> You may use the Service and Generated Output solely for your own internal business purposes (or personal purposes if you are an individual consumer) and not for providing services to third parties, reselling, sublicensing, or white-labelling.</p>
            <p><strong>2.3 Hosting Location and Transfers.</strong> The Service is hosted on Render's cloud infrastructure in Oregon, USA. By using the Service, you consent to your data being stored and processed in the United States and in any other country where Fokal or its Sub-Processors operate.</p>
            <p><strong>2.4 Customer-Site Crawling.</strong> By supplying a brand domain or competitor domain, you expressly authorise Fokal to crawl, cache, and analyse those websites (including all sub-pages) for the purpose of providing the Service. Crawling may persist even if you later delete your account and may occur without your further intervention.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="separator"></div>

        <section>
            <h2>3. Modifications and Beta Features</h2>
            <p><strong>3.1 Platform Evolution.</strong> Fokal is an evolving platform. We may add, modify, or remove features (including beta or experimental features) at any time. We will endeavour to notify you of material changes that diminish core functionality. Continued use after a change constitutes acceptance.</p>
            <p><strong>3.2 Beta Features.</strong> Any feature labelled "beta", "preview", "experimental", or similar is offered "as is", may be discontinued at any time, and may be subject to additional terms.</p>
            <p><strong>3.3 Pricing Changes.</strong> Launch pricing is promotional. We reserve the right to change plan structures or prices. Price increases take effect on renewal, and we will provide at least thirty (30) days' prior notice. You may cancel before the new price applies.</p>
            <p><strong>3.4 Amendments to Agreement.</strong> We may amend this Agreement to reflect changes in law, features, or business requirements. Material amendments become effective seven (7) days after notice unless required sooner by law. If you object, you may terminate before the effective date; otherwise, continuing to use the Service constitutes acceptance.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>4. Account Registration and Security</h2>

            <p><strong>4.2 Authentication.</strong> Access is secured via magic-link email login and/or OAuth. You are responsible for safeguarding your email account and any credentials.</p>
            <p><strong>4.3 Single-Seat Restriction.</strong> Each Starter subscription is limited to one individual human user. Sharing logins, simultaneous sessions from multiple people, or other work-arounds are prohibited. We may monitor usage (IP/device, concurrent sessions) and suspend or terminate accounts that violate this clause.</p>
            <p><strong>4.4 Security Incidents.</strong> You must promptly notify us of unauthorised access or suspected breaches involving your account. We may disable or reset credentials at our discretion.</p>

            <h2>5. Acceptable Use</h2>
            <p><strong>5.1 Prohibited Conduct.</strong> You shall not:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) reverse engineer, decompile, or attempt to discover the Service's source code or underlying algorithms;</li>
                <li>(b) scrape, crawl, or harvest data from the Service's UI or dashboards by automated means (bots, scripts, or similar);</li>
                <li>(c) circumvent usage limits, seat limits, or security measures;</li>
                <li>(d) input or disseminate unlawful, harmful, infringing, or deceptive content;</li>
                <li>(e) interfere with or overload our infrastructure; or</li>
                <li>(f) violate any applicable law or third-party rights.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>5.2 Accurate Domains; Permission to Scrape.</strong> You warrant that you have all necessary rights and permissions to authorise us to crawl and analyse any domain you provide (whether owned by you or a competitor) and that such crawling may continue after account deletion.</p>
            <p><strong>5.3 Competitive Benchmarking.</strong> Insights on competitor domains must be used responsibly and lawfully. You may not use the Service to harass, defame, or mislead third parties.</p>
            <p><strong>5.4 Attribution.</strong> If you publish or publicly share Proprietary Metrics or other Fokal-derived content, you must credit Fokal (e.g. "Source: Fokal") and retain any watermarks or branding.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>6. Intellectual Property and Data</h2>
            <p><strong>6.1 Ownership by Fokal.</strong> All rights, title, and interest in the Service, Service IP, and Proprietary Metrics remain with Fokal and its licensors.</p>
            <p><strong>6.2 Customer Data Licence.</strong> You grant Fokal a worldwide, royalty-free, sublicensable, irrevocable (except as provided in Section 10) licence to use, reproduce, modify, create derivative works from, distribute, display, and process Customer Data as necessary to (a) operate and improve the Service; (b) train or fine-tune our AI models; and (c) develop new products and services. The Starter Plan does <strong>not</strong> include an opt-out from AI training.</p>
            <p><strong>6.3 Third-Party Content.</strong> Content crawled from public websites (including competitor sites) remains the property of its owners. We rely on fair-use principles to transform and display small snippets for commentary and analysis. If notified of infringement, we will remove or restrict access as appropriate.</p>
            <p><strong>6.4 Generated Output Licence to Customer.</strong> Subject to payment of fees and compliance with this Agreement, Fokal grants you a perpetual, non-exclusive, non-transferable licence to use, reproduce, and publicly distribute Generated Output (e.g. AI-generated articles) without additional attribution, provided you do not misrepresent authorship or remove embedded Fokal branding or Proprietary Metrics.</p>
            <p><strong>6.5 No Exclusivity.</strong> Generated Output is produced by probabilistic AI models and may be identical or similar to output generated for others. You obtain no exclusivity or intellectual-property ownership in Generated Output.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="separator"></div>

        <section>
            <h2>7. AI Output; Disclaimers</h2>
            <p><strong>7.1 Probabilistic Nature.</strong> Generated Output may be inaccurate, outdated, biased, or duplicated. Fokal makes no warranty regarding correctness, completeness, or uniqueness.</p>
            <p><strong>7.2 No Professional Advice.</strong> All insights are informational and not professional, legal, financial, or marketing advice. You must independently verify critical decisions.</p>
            <p><strong>7.3 Defamation and Harmful Content.</strong> AI may occasionally produce offensive or defamatory text. If you believe output violates rights or is harmful, notify us at once; we will review and, at our discretion, remove or amend the content.</p>
            <p><strong>7.4 Third-Party Data Reliability.</strong> Our analysis relies on publicly available or third-party data sources beyond our control. We do not guarantee the Service will detect every brand mention or yield optimal SEO results.</p>
        </section>

        <div class="separator"></div>

        <section>
            <h2>8. Fees and Payment</h2>
            <p><strong>8.1 Subscription Term and Renewals.</strong> Subscriptions run month-to-month or year-to-year (as selected) and renew automatically unless cancelled before the renewal date.</p>
            <p><strong>8.2 Pricing.</strong> Starter pricing is US $50 per month or US $500 per year. Future price changes apply on renewal with thirty (30) days' notice.</p>
            <p><strong>8.3 Taxes.</strong> Prices exclude all applicable taxes. You are responsible for any VAT, GST, sales, withholding, or similar taxes (other than taxes on Fokal's income).</p>
            <p><strong>8.4 Payment Processing.</strong> Payments are processed by Stripe. You authorise recurring charges. Declined payments may result in suspension.</p>
            <p><strong>8.5 No Refunds.</strong> Except where required by law or explicitly stated, all fees are non-refundable. We may issue discretionary credits or refunds for platform errors.</p>
            <p><strong>8.6 Late Payments.</strong> Overdue amounts may accrue interest at 1.5% per month (or the maximum legal rate) and we may recover collection costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>9. Term and Termination</h2>
            <p><strong>9.1 Termination by Customer.</strong> You may cancel via the in-app billing page or by emailing support. Access continues until the end of the paid term.</p>
            <p><strong>9.2 Termination or Suspension by Fokal.</strong> We may suspend or terminate immediately upon:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>(a) material breach (including non-payment) not cured within seven (7) days;</li>
                <li>(b) legal or regulatory requirement;</li>
                <li>(c) security risk or harm to the Service; or</li>
                <li>(d) discontinuation of the Service.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>9.3 Refund upon Our Termination for Convenience.</strong> If we terminate the Service for convenience (not due to your breach), we will refund any unused, prepaid fees on a pro-rata basis.</p>
            <p><strong>9.4 Effects of Termination.</strong> Upon termination: (i) your right to access the Service ceases; (ii) outstanding fees become immediately due; (iii) Sections 5–6, 7, 10–15, and any clause that by nature should survive will survive. We recommend exporting important outputs before closure; we may delete data after termination except as required by law or as retained in aggregated form.</p>

            <h2>10. Privacy and Data Protection</h2>
            <p><strong>10.1 Privacy Policy.</strong> Use of the Service is governed by our separate Privacy Policy, which is incorporated by reference.</p>
            <p><strong>10.2 Analytics.</strong> We track events (e.g. sign-ups, logins, query usage) via Mixpanel and similar tools to improve the Service and compile anonymised benchmarks.</p>
